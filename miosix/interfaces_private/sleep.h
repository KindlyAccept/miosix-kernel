/**
 * \file sleep.h
 * This file contains required functions to implement automatic sleep and
 * deep sleep state switch.
 * 
 * Sleep support allows the kernel idle thread to stop the CPU when no ready
 * thread exists, while leaving al peripherals running. It is a simple
 * optimization supported on almost all processors and is easy to implement,
 * requiring only to implement the sleepCpu() function calling the appropriate
 * machine instruction.
 *
 * Deep sleep support allows to power off also the peripherals when no ready
 * threads exist and the system doesn't require any peripheral to be active
 * (at least, no peripheral that can function also in the deep sleep state).
 * It is a more involved optimization, requiring all peripheral drivers to use
 * DeepSleepLock classes to mark code regions where peripherals are used, and
 * requires to write device specific code to wakeup from deep sleep after a
 * given time to support delays in threads, usually by means of the RTC or a
 * timer that can function also in the deep sleep state.
 *
 * NOTE: deep sleep support is optional as it is only required when the kernel
 * is configured with the WITH_DEEP_SLEEP option, which is disabled by default
 * 
 * NOTE: this interface is meant to be used only by the kernel to implement
 * sleep, not by user code to enter sleep states.
 * When automatic sleep/deep sleep is enabled, it is transparent to applications.
